# Profile-Card-Desing
The card usually adopts a rectangular or rounded shape with clean lines, using a combination of light backgrounds and soft shadows to add depth and make it stand out on the page. 
A profile picture is displayed prominently at the top, typically as a circular image to maintain a clean, aesthetic look.
Below the name, the userâ€™s designation or role (e.g., Front-End Developer, SEO Intern) is displayed in a slightly smaller font.
At the bottom, the card might feature social media icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
